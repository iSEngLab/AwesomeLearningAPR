## Evaluation Metrics
| Metrics | Formula/Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Accuracy | Accuracy measures the percentage of candidate patches in which the sequence predicted by the model equals the ground truth | 
| BLEU | BLUE score measures how similar the predicted candidate patch and the ground truth is |
|  Compilable Patch | Such a candidate patch makes the patched buggy program compile successfully |
| Plausible Patch | Such a compilable patch fixes the buggy functionality without harming existing functionality (i.e., passing all available test suites) |
|  Correct Patch | Such a plausible patch is semantically or syntactically equivalent to the developer patch (i.e., generalizing the potential test suite) |
